Honor code: â€œNo member of the Caltech community shall take unfair advantage of any other member of the Caltech community." Therefore, if you are taking or plan on taking CS24, do not look over these files.

For my CS24 (Intro to Computing Systems) class at Caltech, I implemented a buffer overflow exploit to obtain arbitrary code access and execution on a remote machine by putting several forms of my password on the server.
